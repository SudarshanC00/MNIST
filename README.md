# MNIST Digit Classification

## Overview
This project implements a machine learning model to classify handwritten digits (0-9) using the MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset is a collection of grayscale images of handwritten digits, widely used for benchmarking image classification models. This project provides a Jupyter Notebook that trains a neural network to recognize and classify digits with high accuracy.

## Features
- **Data Loading and Preprocessing**: Loads and preprocesses the MNIST dataset to prepare it for model training.
- **Model Training**: Trains a neural network on the MNIST data for digit classification.
- **Evaluation**: Evaluates the modelâ€™s performance and displays accuracy metrics.

## File Structure
- **MNIST.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook containing code to load, preprocess, train, and evaluate a digit classification model using the MNIST dataset.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/MNIST-Digit-Classification.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd MNIST-Digit-Classification
   ```
3. Install dependencies (e.g., TensorFlow, Keras, etc.):
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook MNIST.ipynb
   ```
2. Run the cells in the notebook to:
   - Load and preprocess the MNIST data.
   - Define and train the neural network model.
   - Evaluate the model's performance and view accuracy metrics.

## Model Details
- **Dataset**: MNIST dataset containing 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images of handwritten digits.
- **Model Architecture**: A neural network suitable for image classification tasks, optimized for the MNIST dataset.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Accuracy and loss metrics are used to evaluate model performance.

## Dependencies
- **Jupyter Notebook**: To run and explore the code interactively.
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: For building and training the neural network model.
- **NumPy**: For handling numerical data.
- **Matplotlib**: For visualizing data and model performance.
